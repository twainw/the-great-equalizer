Per Next Gen Stats, they rank 32nd in yards per carry (2.8), 31st in explosive (10+ yard) run % (3.6%), and have picked up just five first downs. Their overall run success rate of 20% is dead last in the NFL per RBSDM.com.\n\nWith a below-average passing efficiency, the Raiders hope that a marginal improvement in their ability to run the ball will help them win games. Head Coach Antonio Pierce expressed frustration and and dissatisfaction with the scheme after losing to the 25th best run defense of the Carolina Panthers, in which they averaged -0.51 EPA per run (worst performance of week 3). Coming into the season, the Raiders hoped to depend on multiple running backs to be productive at a cheaper total cost than what they would have paid Josh Jacobs. For the next several weeks, I expect the Raiders to try out different types of runs, personnel packages, offensive line combinations, and running back rotations. Perhaps it will raise their floor, but it is difficult to imagine the run game being worse."

    "text": "Malik Nabers is awesome\nMalik Nabers, a rookie wide receiver, is currently leading the league in target share at 37.8%. Among receivers with at least 20 targets, per Next Gen Stats he is 5th in total receiving yards (271), 10th in YAC per reception (5.8), 5th in EPA per target, and scored three touchdowns. His week 3 performance against the Cleveland Browns is an excellent example of what makes him a dynamic receiver.\n\n\nIn the clip above against press-man, Nabers uses a skip-go to break the press, but the cornerback mirrors him well. And the corner stays on the route even after Nabers tries a stutter step. But he still makes a spectacular leaping catch and gets both feet down for a 28-yard gain.\n\nOn the same drive three plays later, Nabers motions to the left side of the formation and is one-on-one again. He again gets open at the catch point and makes a leaping catch for the touchdown against the corner trying hard to catch-up. These clips are great examples of his body control on the sideline and ability to make difficult catches.\n\nWith 32 seconds left in the half and one timeout, the Giants are up a touchdown and looking to extend their lead. Against another one-on-one, Nabers runs a slant and gets open for a 12-yard gain and a first down. Although I do not know for sure, Nabers probably knew his best option was to run to the boundary after the catch to get out of bounds and the Giants’ last timeout.\n\nOn the above play, the Giants motion another wide receiver (#17) before the snap to a slant-flat concept. The Browns’ safety probably expected an out route, but Nabers runs a slant and is wide open for the touchdown after the linebacker (#6) moves out of the throwing window.\n\nMaking big plays off of slot fades was his specialty at LSU. In the clip above, he beats the press off of a good release and gets open down the field. If Daniel Jones threw a better ball, Nabers would have had an even more productive game.\nIn fairness, it is only week 3, and it will be tough for anyone to sustain a 37.8% target share for an entire season. Davante Adams was last year’s leader in target share was 33%. However, it is exciting to see a promising rookie wide receiver thrive, and there is no reason why the Giants should not target him double-digit times in every single game. Nabers is a star in the making."

    "text": "More things NFL\n\nThe Vikings have one of the best defenses\nHaving multiple defenders with experience in his system, DC Brian Flores can run complex coverages and create pressure on the opposing QBs. As a result, they allow offenses to score on just 18.8% of their drives, the best in the NFL as of week 3.\n\n\n\nJavon Hargrave partially tore his triceps against the L.A. Rams and will be out for the season\nInjuries keep piling up for the San Francisco 49ers. It is hard to imagine this team making a deep playoff run with a thin defensive line and an injured roster. Many of their players are also dealing with personal tragedies. I also have doubts about the 49ers’ offensive line playing well. Not to mention the frustratingly poor loss against the Rams. I think I prefer not to talk about the 49ers this season.\n\n\nMatt LaFleur continues finding success in the post-Rodgers era\nAfter Jordan Love’s week 1 injury, Matt LaFleur had plenty of reason to worry about winning games in Love’s absence. And yet, he is 2-0 with Malik Willis. LaFleur continues to show why he is one of the best coaches in the league.\n\n\n\nBengals’ defense is a tragedy\nDespite their offense playing the best game of the season, the Bengals lost. Despite averaging 0.41 EPA/play on offense, the Bengals lost. For context, Mahomes in 2022 averaged 0.302 EPA/play. They are also 0-3. It seems the Bengals’ plan on defense this season is “Trey Hendrickson, go do something!” Their defensive draft picks have yet to help this unit turn around its fortunes, and I do not know if they will find the players via in-season trades. It is unlikely the Bengals make the playoffs.\n\n\n\nChiefs are very good. They will be fine. They are likely winning the Super Bowl.\n\n\nJosh Allen"

    "section": "Compared to his peers, Lamar Jackson struggles when defenses bring more pass rushers",
    "text": "Compared to his peers, Lamar Jackson struggles when defenses bring more pass rushers\nFor a few years now, defenses have been able to slow down Lamar by forcing him to decide where to go with the ball with little time to read the defense. Since 2019, he ranks 29th out of 34 Quarterbacks in EPA/play on throws of less than 2.5 seconds.\n\nLamar struggled against heavy blitzes in 2023 compared to other elite Quarterbacks. He excelled against four or five pass rushers and ranked 7th in EPA/Play. But against six or seven pass rushers, he was 23rd in EPA/Play, a tendency the Kansas City Chiefs exploited in last year’s AFC Championship Game. On 7 heavy blitzes, Lamar completed 1 pass for 5 yards, took 1 sack, and averaged -0.65 EPA/play.\n\nYet, there are many reasons to be optimistic\nLamar has not had an elite offensive play-caller or a great supporting cast for most of his career. This matters because an offensive supporting cast significantly helps (hinders) the ability to beat blitzes. In the AFC Championship Game, the Ravens’ receivers struggled to get open against the Chiefs. Mark Andrews was not fully healthy, Odell Beckham Jr. was ineffective, Zay Flowers made costly mistakes, and offensive coordinator Todd Monken did not adapt his game plan and leverage the offense’s strengths.\nThis was Lamar’s first year in a system aimed at developing him as a passer, where he had the keys to the offense and still won MVP. Lamar also proved last year that believing in him to continue growing as a Quarterback is worthwhile. And I think there is an universe where he plays the best football of his career next year, a year where it feels it is impossible that defenses can stop him. And it is why I am very optimistic for Lamar in 2024."

    "text": "Super Bowl hangover is frustrating\n\nI do not have much to say about the painful experience of watching my team, the 49ers, lose another Super Bowl. I think Steve Young put it best when reflecting on 2023 and what the future holds for the current roster.\n\nThe most pressure was last year, right? Because last year the Rams are down, the whole division is down, Seahawks are down, Cardinals are way down,” Young said. “In the playoffs, you play a Packers team that’s been middling the whole time, you got an upstart Lions squad. And you’re like ’That’s how we get to the Super Bowl?\n\n\nBut next year, I think the Rams will be better, Marvin Harrison Jr. will make the Cards better, the Seahawks will be better, the Lions will be better, the Packers will be better,” Young added. “It’s going to get better and we’re probably not – I don’t know if we’ll get better but hopefully, we stay the same – and still beat the rank and file with this amazing roster we have … what just happened was a big miss. It just was. It’s too bad.\n\nI find it difficult to be optimistic about 2024. The 49ers will have one of the oldest rosters in the league next year by average age (~27 years), and one of the most expensive (~$255M) per OverTheCap. I do not want to bet on injury luck in a good NFC. It is hard to know if and when, but I do not think the 49ers will win the Super Bowl anytime soon."

When Lynch and Shanahan interviewed with the 49ers in 2017, they were both asked “You have 150 pts in your salary cap. How are you allocating resources?”\nLynch, a Hall of Fame Safety, considered the question from the standpoint of what allowed his NFL career to thrive, especially in Tampa Bay, where he won a Super Bowl. Shanahan, a very successful offensive coordinator for many years, considered it from his perspective as an offensive architect: What is the one thing over the years that has caused problems for his offenses?\nEven though the two were interviewed separately, they gave the same answer: invest a lot in the defensive line. It should be the great equalizer against the best Quarterbacks like Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe duo turned around one of the worst teams in the NFL into a Super Bowl contender, in large part due to a great defensive line. But their roster decisions have also had very high opportunity costs such as passing on Patrick Mahomes in 2017, CeeDee Lamb or Tristan Wirfs in 2020, the Trey Lance trade in 2021, all the draft picks invested in Running Backs, drafting Jake Moody in 2023, etc. The consequences of those decisions loom large in my mind because I think they were the reason behind the 49ers shortcomings in two NFC title games and one Super Bowl. But in hindsight, many fans like myself are happy to have Shanahan and Lynch.\nThe 49ers’ success (and failures) since 2017 has changed how I think about football. I still love watching the games but have come to appreciate the off-the-field aspects like roster construction, coaching, culture, and how teams allocate scarce resources like cap space and draft capital.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2023 season was marked by struggles to score points for NFL offenses. Scoring has decreased in the last three seasons, particularly since 2020 when offenses routinely scored touchdowns. At the end of 2010, many teams like the Chiefs, Bills, Ravens, Rams, 49ers, Bengals, and Packers invested in their offense to turn their fortunes around and win a Super Bowl. As a result, NFL offenses reached a point in 2020 where they felt unstoppable, averaging 0.10 EPA per pass and 23 points per game. But then, defenses responded.\nOffenses last year averaged just 0.028 EPA per pass and a -0.017 EPA per play, the lowest ever since 2018. Even standard counting stats are stark. Offenses last year averaged a 55% red zone %, compared to 59% in 2020 and only 1.88 points per drive, a noticeable decrease from over 2 points per drive seen consistently between 2018 and 2021. Only 36% of drives are ending in a score compared to 40% in 2020.\n\n\n\n\nA recent influx of young quarterbacks and veterans retiring resulted in 20 quarterbacks with less than five years of experience playing last year. Matthew Stafford was the only starting quarterback with 13 or more years of experience to log more than 300 plays—a stark contrast from 2020 when the league had 6. Other veterans were either injured or benched:\n\nInjured: Trevor Lawrence, Aaron Rodgers, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, Kirk Cousins, Geno Smith, and Jalen Hurts.\nBenched: Jimmy Garoppolo, Russell Wilson, Ryan Tannehill.\nRetired: Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Andrew Luck , Alex Smith\n\nExperience matters because young quarterbacks need time to learn an NFL offense, how to adjust pass protection, how to read defenses, how to attack throwing windows in the NFL that close faster than what they are used to, and get through the grind of a season.

    "text": "The 2023 season was marked by struggles to score points for NFL offenses. Scoring has decreased in the last three seasons, particularly since 2020 when offenses routinely scored touchdowns. At the end of 2010, many teams like the Chiefs, Bills, Ravens, Rams, 49ers, Bengals, and Packers invested in their offense to turn their fortunes around and win a Super Bowl. As a result, NFL offenses reached a point in 2020 where they felt unstoppable, averaging 0.10 EPA per pass and 23 points per game. But then, defenses responded.\nOffenses last year averaged just 0.028 EPA per pass and a -0.017 EPA per play, the lowest ever since 2018. Even standard counting stats are stark. Offenses last year averaged a 55% red zone %, compared to 59% in 2020 and only 1.88 points per drive, a noticeable decrease from over 2 points per drive seen consistently between 2018 and 2021. Only 36% of drives are ending in a score compared to 40% in 2020.\n\n\n\n\nA recent influx of young quarterbacks and veterans retiring resulted in 20 quarterbacks with less than five years of experience playing last year. Matthew Stafford was the only starting quarterback with 13 or more years of experience to log more than 300 plays—a stark contrast from 2020 when the league had 6. Other veterans were either injured or benched:\n\nInjured: Trevor Lawrence, Aaron Rodgers, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, Kirk Cousins, Geno Smith, and Jalen Hurts.\nBenched: Jimmy Garoppolo, Russell Wilson, Ryan Tannehill.\nRetired: Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Andrew Luck , Alex Smith\n\nExperience matters because young quarterbacks need time to learn an NFL offense, how to adjust pass protection, how to read defenses, how to attack throwing windows in the NFL that close faster than what they are used to, and get through the grind of a season. But, more and more young quarterbacks are under pressure to turn around struggling franchises in a short time, most of them with little help. And unsurprisingly, young quarterbacks struggled in 2023 compared to the veterans.\n\n\n\nThe 5-8 YRS group includes P.Mahomes, J.Allen, L.Jackson, D.Prescott, J.Goff, and B.Mayfield.

    "text": "Eagles’ success on defense\nSuper Bowl 59 has several great examples of a defense’s ability to marry the coverage with the pass rush.\n\nEagles’ coverage plan and execution was excellent\n\nThe Eagles are in man coverage, and all four cornerbacks did an excellent job of staying on their receiver. Isiah Rodgers especially did a tremendous job picking up Hollywood Brown off of the switch release and taking away Mahomes’ first read. But just when Mahomes looks for a throw elsewhere, he gets pressured. The Eagles’ front lined up a certain way to get their DTs a one-on-one matchup while the DEs use bull rushes (trying to win through the blocker) to compress the pocket. Mahomes tries to get out but the Eagles pass rush forces him to roll out backwars and attempt a throw under pressure. Gardner-Johnson comes downfield to break up the pass.\n\nLater in the game, the Chiefs call a shot play but Quinyon Mitchell runs step-for-step with Xavier Worthy. Mahomes checks it down to Smith-Schuster, and the Eagles defenders rally to make the tackle. Two plays later, the Chiefs punt.\n\nOn the pick-six, Quinyon Mitchell runs with Deandre Hopkins ready to break up the pass at the catch point. On what looks like either a designed rollout or Mahome rolling out to the right to buy extra time, LB Zack Baun covers the flat, and CB DeJean falls back to the left while reading the QB’s eyes. As soon as the ball is released, DeJean runs to the other side, intercepts the pass, and sprints into the end zone.\n\n\nBut pressure defined the game\nBut the main story on defense for the Eagles’ was their pass rush. In the first half, the Eagles pressured Mahomes on 47.1% of his dropbacks per NGS without blitzing. When under pressure, he completed just three passes out of nine attempts and was sacked six times. With Joe Thuney playing out of position at left tackle and Mike Caliendo replacing Thuney at left guard, the Eagles’ pass rush consistenly compressed the pocket and made Mahomes uncomfortable all game.\n\nThe Eagles line up with two 2i’s and run a stunt to the backside. Mahomes tries to get out of the pocket but runs into pressure from Josh Sweat and is eventually sacked. On a 3rd and 9 with over five minutes left in the first half while down seventeen, the Chiefs were trying to put some points on the board and keep their comeback chances alive. Instead, they had to punt.\n\nNo one on the Chiefs offensive line had a good game. LG Caliendo allowed seven pressures, LT Thuney allowed six, Jawaan Taylor allowed six at RT, and RG Trey Smith allowed four pressures. Joe Thuney in particular stands out on a few different plays where the DE wins with power and drives Thuney into Mahomes forcing errant throws.\n \nThe entire defensive line for the Eagles played their best football against the defending champs. Even when Josh Sweat or Jalen Carter were not on the field, their young players like Jalyx Hunt or Moro Ojomo impacted the game. Six different players on the Eagles ended the day with at least two pressures."

    "text": "Eagles’ success on offense\nComing into this game, my biggest question for the Eagles’ offense was how will they attack the blitz. The Chiefs were 5th in blitz %, 7th in pressure % when blitzed, and 7th (best) in EPA per pass when blitzed per NGS. I want to highlight plays that show the confidence the Eagles’ offense had in their answers against an aggressive Steve Spagnuolo-coached defense. The pass protection gave Hurts clean pockets to beat the blitz, and with the extra time, Hurts made decisive throws to move the chains.\nOn a side note, I know Saquon Barkley had a meager 16% rushing success rate, but that does not tell the entire story of his impact. And frankly, I don’t care how bad was his rushing production. The Chiefs did everything they could to stop the run, and every defensive coordinator would have done the same to put the onus on the passing game. The clips below show that Barkley’s gravity and pass-pro ability were big reasons behind the Eagles’ passing success. Yes, positional value matters. But star value is a force multiplier regardless of position.\n\nConfidence oozed out of the Eagles’ passing attack\n\nThe early go ball to A.J. Brown was called back for offensive pass interference, but is an example of the Eagles’ excellent pass protection and Hurts’ post-snap operation. The Chiefs bring five rushers, but the offensive line allows Hurts to operate from a clean pocket. Despite having Barkley underneath, Hurts takes the one-on-one to Brown against CB Trent McDuffie with no safety help over the top.\nAnother example of Hurts’ decisiveness and connection with A.J Brown came in the second quarter. Before the snap, Hurts identifies the one-on-one versus Trent McDuffie. Because Brown has the size advantage over most DBs, he gets the signal pre-snap that he’s getting the ball. On a back shoulder deep curl, Hurts places the ball exactly where it needs to be for completion on a 3rd and 7.\n\n\nOn the 27-yard completion to Jahan Dotson, Spags called a fire zone where the DE (Omenihu) drops into coverage while the LB (Bolton) and DB (Conner) rush from the right. Barkley picks up the blitzing DB and gives Hurts a clean to pocket to get the throw off. I also liked how the LG Dickerson helps out the Center after seeing Omenihu drop in coverage. Jahan Dotson wins his one-on-one, and Hurts makes a nice throw that sets up the touchdown.\n\nThe next clips is Hurts’ 16-yard third-down scramble. One key thing that makes this scramble work is Saquon Barkley. This is an example of Green Dog where Nick Bolton is supposed to cover Barkley but blitzes if Barkley stays in protection. Because Barkley decides to run out of the backfield, Hurts has the space for an explosive gain.\n\n\nOffensive line\nI also want to highlight the offensive line execution on the 20-yard completion to Dallas Goedert. The Chiefs run a simulated pressure with DE (Omenihu) to the left dropping into coverage and LB (Tranquill) rushing the QB from the right. In a split second, LG Dickerson passes off the DT to the left tackle, scans the field for additional rushers, and works backside to pick up Tranquill. Not a single offensive lineman loses their block, giving Hurts plenty of time to find Goedert for an explosive play against blown coverage.\n\nOn the DeVonta Smith touchdown, all three Chiefs’ LBs bite on the play fake because they see a pulling guard and the fake-handoff thinking Barkley is running the ball. The deep left safety runs down the field to cover a wide-open TE (Goedert) but inadvertently leaves the outside CB one-on-one against Smith. Hurts strikes with a perfect throw.\n\nThe plays above are really about the execution of the entire offense. From the offensive line’s ability to sort things both before and after the snap, Barkley’s gravity, the WRs getting open, and Hurts making nice throws. The best offensive execution happens when your talented players are confident in the answers the play-caller dials up. And when they are decisive in how they attack a defense. By being aggressive, the Eagles scored on their possessions and made the Chiefs play catch-up who weren’t able to keep up, leading to a blowout."
