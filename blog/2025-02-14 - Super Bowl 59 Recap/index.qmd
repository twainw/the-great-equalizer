## Introduction

Talent advantages in the trenches decides games, but Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs had the benefit of doubt going into Super Bowl 59. They have been very successfull in the quick game for years, especially against defenses with an aggressive pass rush. And yet, the Eagles dismantled the Chiefs. This wasn't a 40-22 game. It was a 40-6 game. The Chiefs scored their last 16 pts in garbage time after the Eagles replaced their defensive starters with backups. In the first half, they had 23 total yards and 1 first down with Mahomes averaging a **-1.3 EPA per pass** according to Next Gen Stats. He finished the game with a -0.46 EPA per dropback and three turnovers.

Super Bowl 59 was Vic Fangio's magnum opus. He's been one of the most influential defensive coaches in the league but did not have his signature playoff win like his peers Steve Spagnuolo or Bill Belichick. [Back in 2019](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27447121/mcvay-shanahan-lafleur-qbs-playbooks-learning-dc), Sean McVay, Kyle Shanahan, and Matt LaFleur were asked which coach's defense is the most difficult to gameplan for and attack. All three answered [Vic Fangio](https://www.readoptional.com/p/the-book-of-fangio-part-i-the-philosophy). He built the blueprint to stopping McVay's offense in a 2018 regular season game, a plan heavily used by the Patriots to hold the Rams to just three points and win the Super Bowl. And now Fangio has his signature game, the one to hang his hat on, against one of the greatest Head Coach and Quarterback duos ever.

Two other members of the Eagles organization that deserve a lot of credit for this Super Bowl are Head Coach Nick Sirriani and General Manager Howie Roseman. Last year, the Eagles lost five of their last six games and got embarrassed in the playoffs. But despite the outside noise and the lingering questions from last year, Sirriani figured out a way to lead his team to a championship. And very few General Managers in the NFL understand how to acquire talent better than Howie Roseman. He has won two Super Bowls in seven years with two different Head Coach and Quarterback duos.

## Eagles' success on defense

Super Bowl 59 has several great examples of a defense's ability to marry the coverage with the pass rush.

### Eagles' coverage plan and execution was excellent

{{< tweet user=Nate_Tice id=1889004031819088220 >}}

The Eagles are in man coverage, and all four cornerbacks did an excellent job of staying on their receiver. Isiah Rodgers especially did a tremendous job picking up Hollywood Brown off of the switch release and taking away Mahomes' first read. But just when Mahomes looks for a throw elsewhere, he gets pressured. The Eagles' front lined up a certain way to get their DTs a one-on-one matchup while the DEs use bull rushes (trying to win through the blocker) to compress the pocket. Mahomes tries to get out but the Eagles pass rush forces him to roll out backwars and attempt a throw under pressure. Gardner-Johnson comes downfield to break up the pass.

Later in the game, the Chiefs call a shot play but Quinyon Mitchell runs step-for-step with Xavier Worthy. Mahomes checks it down to Smith-Schuster, and the Eagles defenders rally to make the tackle. Two plays later, the Chiefs punt.

On the pick-six, Quinyon Mitchell runs with Deandre Hopkins ready to break up the pass at the catch point. On what looks like either a designed rollout or Mahome rolling out to the right to buy extra time, LB Zack Baun covers the flat, and CB DeJean falls back to the left while reading the QB's eyes. As soon as the ball is released, DeJean runs to the other side, intercepts the pass, and sprints into the end zone.

### But *pressure* defined the game

But the main story on defense for the Eagles' was their pass rush. In the first half, the Eagles pressured Mahomes on **47.1%** of his dropbacks per NGS without blitzing. When under pressure, he completed just three passes out of nine attempts and was **sacked six times**. With Joe Thuney playing out of position at left tackle and Mike Caliendo replacing Thuney at left guard, the Eagles' pass rush consistenly compressed the pocket and made Mahomes uncomfortable all game.

The Eagles line up with two 2i's and run a stunt to the backside. Mahomes tries to get out of the pocket but runs into pressure from Josh Sweat and is eventually sacked. On a 3rd and 9 with over five minutes left in the first half while down seventeen, the Chiefs were trying to put some points on the board and keep their comeback chances alive. Instead, they had to punt.

{{< tweet user=billbarnwell id=1888996865582252515 >}}

No one on the Chiefs offensive line had a good game. LG Caliendo allowed seven pressures, LT Thuney allowed six, Jawaan Taylor allowed six at RT, and RG Trey Smith allowed four pressures. Joe Thuney in particular stands out on a few different plays where the DE wins with power and drives Thuney into Mahomes forcing errant throws.

The entire defensive line for the Eagles played their best football against the defending champs. Even when Josh Sweat or Jalen Carter were not on the field, their young players like Jalyx Hunt or Moro Ojomo impacted the game. **Six different players** on the Eagles ended the day with at least two pressures.

## Eagles' success on offense

Coming into this game, my biggest question for the Eagles' offense was how will they attack the blitz. The Chiefs were **5th in blitz %, 7th in pressure % when blitzed, and 7th (best) in EPA per pass when blitzed** per NGS. I want to highlight plays that show the confidence the Eagles' offense had in their answers against an aggressive Steve Spagnuolo-coached defense. The pass protection gave Hurts clean pockets to beat the blitz, and with the extra time, Hurts made decisive throws to move the chains.

On a side note, I know Saquon Barkley had a meager **16%** rushing success rate, but that does not tell the entire story of his impact. And frankly, I don't care how bad was his rushing production. The Chiefs did everything they to stop the run, and every defensive coordinator would have done the same to put the onus on the passing game. The clips below show that Barkley's gravity and pass-pro ability were big reasons behind the Eagles' passing success. Yes, positional value matters. But star value is a force multiplier regardless of position.

### Confidence oozed out of the Eagles' passing attack

{{< video 176_sb59.mp4 >}}

The early go ball to A.J. Brown was called back for offensive pass interference, but is an example of the Eagles' excellent pass protection and Hurts' post-snap operation. The Chiefs bring five rushers, but the offensive line allows Hurts to operate from a clean pocket. Despite having Barkley underneath, Hurts takes the one-on-one to Brown against CB Trent McDuffie with no safety help over the top.

Another example of Hurts' decisiveness and connection with A.J Brown came in the second quarter. Before the snap, Hurts identifies the one-on-one versus Trent McDuffie. Because Brown has the size advantage over most DBs, he gets the signal pre-snap that he's getting the ball. On a back shoulder deep curl, Hurts places the ball exactly where it needs to be for completion on a 3rd and 7.

On the 27-yard completion to Jahan Dotson, Spags called a ***fire zone*** where the DE (Omenihu) drops into coverage while the LB (Bolton) and DB (Conner) rush from the right. Barkley picks up the blitzing DB and gives Hurts a clean to pocket to get the throw off. I also liked how the LG Dickerson helps out the Center after seeing Omenihu drop in coverage. Jahan Dotson wins his one-on-one, and Hurts makes a nice throw that sets up the touchdown.

The next play is a Hurts' 16-yard third-down scramble. One key thing that makes this scramble work is Saquon Barkley. This is an example of ***Green Dog*** where Nick Bolton is supposed to cover Barkley but blitzes if Barkley stays in protection. Because Barkley decides to run out of the backfield, Hurts has the space for an explosive gain.

### Offensive line

I also want to highlight the offensive line execution on the 20-yard completion to Dallas Goedert. The Chiefs run a ***simulated pressure** with DE (Omenihu) to the left dropping into coverage and LB (Tranquill) rushing the QB from the right. In a split second, LG Dickerson passes off the DT to the LT, scans the field to make sure no one is rushing from the playside, and works backside to pick up Tranquill. And not a single offensive lineman loses their block, giving Hurts plenty of time to find Goedert for an explosive play against blown coverage.

{{< video 411_sb59.mp4 >}}

On the DeVonta Smith touchdown, all three Chiefs' LBs bite on the play fake because they see a pulling guard and the fake-handoff thinking Barkley is running the ball. The deep left safety runs down the field to cover a wide-open TE (Goedert) but inadvertently leaves the outside CB one-on-one against Smith. Hurts strikes with a perfect throw.

{{< video 2858_sb59.mp4 >}}

The plays above are really about the execution of the entire offense. From the offensive line's ability to sort things both before and after the snap, Barkley's gravity, the WRs getting open, and Hurts making nice throws. The best offensive execution happens when your talented players are confident in the answers the play-caller dials up. And when they are decisive in how they attack a defense. By being aggressive, the Eagles scored on their possessions and made the Chiefs play catch-up who weren't able to keep up, leading to a blowout.
