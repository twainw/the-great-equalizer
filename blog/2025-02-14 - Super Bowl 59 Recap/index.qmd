## Introduction

Talent advantages in the trenches typically decides games, but Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs had the benefit of doubt going into Super Bowl 59. The Chiefs have been very successfull in the quick game for years, especially against defenses with an aggressive pass rush. And yet, the Eagles dismantled the Chiefs. This wasn't a 40-22 game. Rather, it was a 40-6 game. The Chiefs only scored their last 16 pts in garbage time after the Eagles replaced their defensive starters with backups. In the first half, the Chiefs had just 23 total yards and 1 first down with Mahomes averaging a **-1.3 EPA per pass** according to Next Gen Stats. He finished the game with a -0.46 EPA/dropback and three turnovers.

Super Bowl 59 was Vic Fangio's magnum opus. He has been one of the most influential defensive coaches in the league but did not have his signature playoff game like his peers Steve Spagnuolo or Bill Belichick. [Back in 2019](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27447121/mcvay-shanahan-lafleur-qbs-playbooks-learning-dc), Sean McVay, Kyle Shanahan, and Matt LaFleur were all asked which coach's defense is the most difficult to diagnose and attack. And they all said Vic Fangio because Fangio's [defensive philosophy](https://www.readoptional.com/p/the-book-of-fangio-part-i-the-philosophy) has had answers against high-powered offenses. He built the blueprint to stopping McVay's offense in a 2018 regular season game, a plan heavily used by the Patriots to hold the Rams to just three points and win the Super Bowl. And now, Fangio has his signature game, the one to hang his hat on, against one of the greatest Head Coach and Quarterback duo ever. 

Two other members of the Eagles organization that deserve a lot of credit for this Super Bowl are Head Coach Nick Sirriani and General Manager Howie Roseman. Last year, the Eagles lost five of their last six games and got embarrassed in the playoffs. But despite the outside noise and the lingering questions from last year, Sirriani figured out a way to lead his team to a championship. And very few General Managers in the NFL understand how to acquire talent better than Howie Roseman. He has won two Super Bowls in seven years with two different head coaches and two starting quarterbacks.

## Eagles' success on defense

Super Bowl 59 has great examples of the Eagles' ability to marry their coverage call with their pass rush and not allow the Chiefs to find success in the passing game.

### Upon Review, the Eagles' coverage stands out

{{< tweet user=Nate_Tice id=1889004031819088220 >}}

The Eagles are in man coverage, and all four cornerbacks do an excellent job of staying on with the receivers. Isiah Rodgers especially did a tremendous job of staying on Hollywood Brown despite the switch release and took away Mahomes' first read. But just when Mahomes looks for a throw elsewhere, he gets pressured. The Eagles' front lined up a certain way to get one of their DTs a one-on-one matchup. The edge defenders use bull rushes, trying to win through the blocker, and compress the pocket. Both DTs fight through a lot of contact, and the rest of the line relentlessly rushes Mahomes until the play is over. Gardner-Johnson comes downfield to break up the pass.

The Chiefs call a shot play but Quinyon Mitchell ran with Xavier Worthy step-for-step. Mahomes checks it down to Smith-Schuster, and the Eagles DBs rally to make the tackle. Two plays later, the Chiefs punt.

Mahomes is reading the right side, but there is no one he can throw the ball to. And because of the pressure, he has to let go of the ball but falls incomplete. 

On the pick-six, Quinyon Mitchell runs with Deandre Hopkins ready to break the pass up at the catch point. On what looks like either a designed rollout or rollout to the right to have extra time, LB Zack Baun covers the flat, and DeJean falls back to the left while reading Mahomes. As soon as the ball is released, DeJean runs to the other side, intercepts the pass, and sprints into the end zone.

### But *pressure* defined the game

But the main story on the defensive side of the ball is the Eagles' pass rush. In the first half, the Eagles pressured Mahomes on **47.1%** of his dropbacks per NGS without blitzing. Mahomes under-pressure completed just three passes out of nine attempts and was **sacked six times**. With Joe Thuney playing out of position at left tackle and Mike Caliendo replacing Thuney at left guard, the Eagles' pass rush consistenly compressed the pocket and made Mahomes uncomfortable to affect every throw and stay relentless even when Mahomes tried to extend the play.

The Eagles line up with two 2i's and run a stunt to the backside. But instead of staying in the pocket, Mahomes climbs the pocket but runs into pressure by Josh Sweat and is sacked On a 3rd and 9 with over five minutes left in the first half and down seventeen, the Chiefs were trying to put some points on the board and keep their comeback chances alive. Instead, they had to punt. 

{{< tweet user=billbarnwell id=1888996865582252515 >}}

No one on the Chiefs offensive line had a good game. LG Caliendo allowed seven pressures, LT Thuney allowed six, Jawaan Taylor allowed six at right tackle, and RG Trey Smith allowed four. Joe Thuney in particular stands out on a couple different plays where the DE wins with power and drives Thuney into Mahomes which forced errant throws.

The entire defensive line for the Eagles played their best football against the defending champs. Even when Josh Sweat or Jalen Carter were not on the field, the Eagles' young rotation of linemen like Jalyx Hunt or Moro Ojomo impacted the game Six different players on the Eagles ended the day with at least two QB pressures. They all played with the attitude and physicality needed to win this game.

## Eagles' success on offense

Coming into this game, my biggest question for the Eagles' offense was how will they find answers against the Chiefs' blitz packages. Chiefs were **5th in blitz %, 7th in pressure % when blitzed, and 7th (best) in EPA per pass** when blitzed per NGS. But the Eagles had answers. The pass protection gave Hurts clean pockets to beat the blitz, and with extra time, Hurts made decisive throws to move the chains. 

On a side note, I know that Saquon Barkley had a *16%* rushing success rate in the Super Bowl (NGS), but that is not the entire story of his impact. And honestly, I do not care what his production on the ground was because the Chiefs did everything they could to stop the run. Most defensive coordinators would have done the same to put the onus of winning on the QB and an offensive line. And you live with the result if the QB still manages to win. The clips below show that Barkley's gravity and pass-pro ability were a key reason behind the Eagles' passing success. So, re-watch the clips and appreciate what makes Saquon Barkley awesome. Positional value matters, but star value is a force multiplier regardless of position.

### Confidence oozed out of the Eagles' passing attack

{{< video 176_sb59.mp4 >}}

The early go ball to A.J. Brown was called back for offensive pass interference, but that doesn't negate it as a great example of excellent pass pro and Hurts' post-snap operation. The Chiefs bring five rushers, but all five offensive linemen block their man, and Barkley becomes an auxiliary option underneath. Instead, Hurts takes the one-on-one against CB Trent McDuffie with no safety help over the top. Althoug McDuffie is a stud, A.J. Brown has the size advantage over most CBs.

{{< video 1252_sb59.mp4 >}}

Another example of Hurts' decisiveness and his connection with A.J Brown came in the second quarter. Right before the snap, you can see Hurts signaling to A.J. Brown that he'll get the ball as Brown is one one-on-one again versus Trent McDuffie with no help over the top. I thought Hurts did a great job of picking this matchup and throwing a pretty back shoulder exactly where it needs to be for completion on a 3rd and 7.

{{< video 543_sb59.mp4 >}}

On the 27-yard completion to Jahan Dotson, Spags called a fire zone where the DE (Omenihu) to the left drops into coverage while the LB (Bolton) and DB (Conner) rush the passer from the right. The Chiefs bring five, but Barkley blocks the blitzing DB and gives Hurts time to get this throw off (also, watch how the LG Dickerson identifies that he's got no one to block and helps out the C Jurgens). WR Jahan Dotson wins his one-on-one, and Hurts delivered another great throw that sets up the touchdown. These plays highlight the confidence the Eagles' offense had in their answers against an aggressive Steve Spagnuolo-coached defense.

{{< video 2387_sb59.mp4 >}}

The next play is a Hurts' 16-yard third-down scramble. One key thing that makes this scramble work is Saquon Barkley. This is an example of *Green Dog* where Nick Bolton is supposed to cover Barkley but becomes an additional blitzer if Barkley stays in protection. And because Barkley decides to run out of the backfield, Hurts has the space to pick the first down. 

### Offensive line

I want to highlight the offensive line execution on the 20-yard completion to Dallas Goedert. The Chiefs run a sim pressure with DE (Omenihu) to the left dropping into coverage and LB (Tranquill) rushing the QB from the right. In a split second, LG Dickerson passes off the DT (Wharton) to the LT, scans the field to ensure no defender is rushing from the playside, and works backside to pick up LB (Tranquill). And not a single offensive lineman loses their block, giving Hurts plenty of time to find Goedert for an explosive play against blown coverage. 

{{< video 411_sb59.mp4 >}}

On the DeVonta Smith touchdown, all three Chiefs' LBs bite on the play fake because they see a pulling guard and think Barkley is getting the ball. The deep left side covers a wide-open TE (Goedert) but inadvertently leaves the outside CB on one against Smith. Hurts strikes with a perfect throw.

{{< video 2858_sb59.mp4 >}}

The plays above are really about the entire execution of the offense. From the offensive line's ability to sort things pre-snap to the post-snap execution by the blockers, Barkley's gravity, the WRs, and Hurts. When you can be decisive in this league and your talented players are confident in the answers the play-caller dials up, you inevitably are aggressively attacking the defense. Even though their run game wasn't productive and Hurts threw an interception early, the Eagles still managed to put the onus on the Chiefs to make plays who did not execute, culminating in a blowout.
