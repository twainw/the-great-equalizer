## 49ers' defensive line stats paint a troubling picture ahead of the Super Bowl

The 49ers' defense wants to hunt the QB with four pass rushers and drop seven players in coverage. But when rushing four, the 49ers are **average in pressure rate (15th)** and **below average in sack rate (23rd)** this season. And in Super Bowl 58, the 49ers defense faces its toughest challenge this year in Patrick Mahomes, **the best at avoiding sacks.**

In the 2023 regular season, Mahomes faced pressure at the 11th highest rate (23%) but was **sacked at the lowest rate (18%)** among Quarterbacks with at least 250 pass attempts (per Pro Football Reference). He is also one of the best scramblers in the league; On 75 runs, Mahomes picked up a first down 36% of the time, the 6th highest rate among players with at least 50 attempts in 2023. In this year's postseason, he has 0 turnover-worthy plays per PFF.

It will be a tall task for the 49ers defense to force drive-killing sacks and turnovers, especially in a close game. Mahomes has the proven ability to avoid negative plays and capitalize on his opponent's mistakes in the postseason. The 49ers defense needs a lot of answers.
